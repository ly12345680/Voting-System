Clone the repository:\n   ```sh\n   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voting-system.git\n   ```\n2. Open the project in **NetBeans IDE**.\n3. Configure database credentials in `ConnectToDb.java`.\n4. Run the SQL scripts to create the database and tables.\n5. Start the application and log in as Admin or Voter.\n\n## \ud83d\udc4d Sample SQL Queries\nFind the top 10 candidates with the highest votes:\n```sql\nSELECT TOP 10 Candidate.First_name, Candidate.Last_name, COUNT(Votes.V_ID) AS VoteCount\nFROM Candidate\nJOIN Votes ON Candidate.C_ID = Votes.C_ID\nGROUP BY Candidate.C_ID, Candidate.First_name, Candidate.Last_name\nORDER BY VoteCount DESC;\n```\n\nFind the most recent voter:\n```sql\nSELECT TOP 1 Voter.* FROM Voter\nJOIN Votes ON Voter.V_ID = Votes.V_ID\nORDER BY Votes.date DESC;\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udf93 Team Members\n- Nguyễn Hoàng Lý\n- Nguyễn Trần Trung Kỳ\n- Văn Bảo Khánh\n- Nguyễn Trần Hoàng Nam\n- Huỳnh Văn Vĩnh\n\n## \ud83d\udcc4 Project Documentation\n- [Source Code](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LDLDizHy9qtnUsxD4TRLR8vxgaIWUgwj?usp=sharing)\n- [Slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFh3AlX0Ys/94_U_U1F-XZRpzNA56JZKg/edit?utm_content=DAFh3AlX0Ys&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)\n\n\ud83d\udce2 **Vote Smart, Vote Securely!** \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f"""
